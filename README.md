# Market Analysis Log

## Overview
This repository is a personal market thinking and analysis log.

Its purpose is to document how market views form, evolve, and sometimes break under new information. The focus is not on publishing polished research or generating trading signals, but on building a written record of structured investment thinking over time.

Entries range from raw observations and short-term signals to durable theses and deeper analytical reports.

---

## Guiding Principles
- Consistency matters more than frequency  
- Partial and imperfect thoughts are expected  
- Views are allowed to change  
- Writing is used as a tool for thinking, not performance  

Target cadence:
- Approximately one mid-week entry
- Approximately one weekend entry  

Gaps are expected; abandonment is not.

## Tooling
- Markdown (`.md`) files for all writing
- RStudio or a text editor for quick note entry
- Scripts and data are used only when they add clarity

This is a writing-first repository.

## Data and Sources
Data sources vary by entry and may include public market data, company filings, macroeconomic releases, and news or research articles. Sources are typically linked directly within notes or reports rather than centralized.
