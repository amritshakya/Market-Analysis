The health insurance sector crumbled on Tuesday on news the Trump administration
wants to hold Medicare rates almost flat next year. Shares in Humana fell 21%, 
UnitedHealth plunged 20%. and CVS declined 14% at the close. The Wall Street 
Journal earlier reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
proposed to hold payment rates to an average .09% increase next year, far below 
what the companies and Wall Street had expected.
